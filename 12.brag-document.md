### **Writing a “Brag Document”** – Why It’s Essential and How to Do It  

A **brag document** (also called an *accomplishments log*) is a personal record of your achievements, contributions, and positive feedback at work. Many professionals don’t keep track of what they’ve accomplished, making it harder to prove their value when it's time for **performance reviews, promotions, salary negotiations, or job interviews**.  

#### **Why You Need a Brag Document**  
1. **Performance Reviews Become Easy** – When your manager asks, “What have you accomplished this year?” you’ll have a ready answer with data.  
2. **Stronger Promotion & Raise Requests** – Instead of saying, *"I think I deserve a raise,"* you can show concrete evidence of your impact.  
3. **Improves Your Resume & LinkedIn** – Instead of scrambling to remember past projects, you can easily update your professional profiles.  
4. **Boosts Confidence** – Reviewing your wins helps combat imposter syndrome and makes you realize how much progress you’ve made.  
5. **Gives You an Edge in Job Interviews** – You’ll have clear, measurable examples of your achievements when answering questions like *“Tell me about a time when you…”*

### **How to Create a Brag Document**
A brag document doesn’t have to be complicated. You can use a simple Google Doc, Notion page, or even a private email thread.  

#### **What to Include in Your Brag Document**  
✅ **Key Achievements** – List projects you completed, improvements you made, or goals you hit.  
✅ **Metrics & Impact** – Where possible, add numbers (e.g., "Reduced processing time by 30%,” “Increased sales by $50K,” “Improved team efficiency by 20%").  
✅ **Positive Feedback** – If a manager or coworker praises your work in an email or Slack message, save it!  
✅ **New Skills Learned** – Document technical skills, tools, or certifications you’ve gained.  
✅ **Problems Solved** – Write down moments where you went above and beyond to fix something or improve a process.
